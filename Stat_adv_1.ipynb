        "- A random variable is a variable whose value is unknown. It is a function that assigns a real value to an outcome of a random variable. It can be either discrete having certain specific values or continuous with any value in a range.\n",
        "Example: tossing a coin or throwing a dice.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q.2 What are the types of random variables?**\n",
        "- Random variable can be of two following types:\n",
        "  - *Discrete Random Variable*: A discrete random variable take finite and countable number of values. Example of this is tosssing a coin 2 times, let X (random variable) is number of heads then X can be equal to {0,1,2}. These are the only possible values for random variable and as they are finite and no other value is possible for random variable. So, X is discrete random variable.\n",
        "  - *Continuous Random Variable*: A continuous random variable take infinite number of values within a specified range or interval. Example: the average height of people in a city or town. It can take any value under a certain range and have no gaps between values. so, we consider it as continuous random variable.\n",

        "- Discrete distribution is the distribution in which data can only take certain finite and countable values whereas in continuous distribution data values can take any value within a given specified range. In discrete distributions we use probability mass function to represent the distribution while in continuous distribution we have probability density function. Discrete data typically shows information for a particular event while continuous data shows trends in data over time. Overall, we can say in discrete distributions data can assume specific values whereas continuous distributions can take any numeric value, including fractions and decimals. Examples of discrete distribution is bionomial and poisson and examples of continuous are normal and exponential distributions.\n",

The value of pdf lies between 0 and 1 and the value of cdf is greater than zero. Pdf is probability that a random variable will take a value equal to certain value while cdf is the probability that a random variable will take a value less than or equal to the a certain value.\n",

Hence, we standardize the normal distribution so that we can compare any distributions with each other. Moreover, all the tests like z-test, t-test rely on standard normal distribution and standard normal distributions make the calculations easier.\n",

In this the data must be randomly sampled and the samples must not relate with each other.\n",
        "CLT is important because it allows us to make inferences about population parameters based on samples. Moreover, it is useful in statistics tests like z-test and t-test because they require normal distributed data.

It is used to test the population mean is equal to a certain value or when we have to compare sample mean with the population mean. Example average height of students = 50. It is also used to check that the population mean is greater than or less than a certain value or not. This is also known as one-tailed test. Apart from this, z-scores are also used to standardized the normal distribution i.e. making mean=0 and variance=1.\n",

In simple words, it is used to inference a single value of population parameter using a sample parameter. Common point estimates include population mean and population standard deviation. Example average salary of IT employee is 50k.

        "- The confidence interval provides the range of values that is likely to contain the true population parameters. It also tells us about the stablity of our estimate. They are more reliable as they provide range of value rather than a single point estimate. The wider the interval the less precise our estimate is and the narrower the interval the more it will be precised. Example a 95% confidence interval doesn't mean 95 % data points will lie in that interval but is a numerical range which upon repetation of samples will contain true value 95% of the time.\n",

Additionally, the z-score of confidence interval is calcuated to understand how many standard deviations a particular value is from mean. Example for 95% CI z-score is 1.96. These scores determine how far we can extend from sample mean to create an interval. The larger the confidence interval, the larger will be the z-score.\n",

It tells us how far a data point is from the mean value. Lower the z-score closer will the value to the mean. It also allows us to calculate the probability of a score occurring within normal distribution and enables us to compare two scores that have different normal distributions.\n",
